# Benchmark 05: Involute Gear 2

![result_mises](./result_mises.png)

## Settings

- Objective: To compare the performance of CalculiX and FrontISTR on large scale model and various matrix solvers
- Model: Involute gear generated with the part design workbench
  - Analysis type: Static linear
  - 1,177,532 nodes, 793,270 elements(2nd order tetrahedron)
- Parameters:
  - Matrix solver settings
    - CalculiX: iterativecholesky(iterative), spooles(direct)
    - FrontISTR: CG w/ AMG preconditioner(iterative), MUMPS(direct)
- Mesurement Environment
  - OS: Windows 10
  - CPU: Ryzen 3700X @3.60GHz 8cores x 1CPU
  - Memory: 64GB
  - FreeCAD 0.19.1 a88db11
  - FrontISTR v5.2 380f1690
  - FEM\_FrontISTR 8f57d2f3
  - Paralell settings
    - Calculix: `OMP_NUM_THREADS=8`
      - Note that Iterativecholesky solver runs sequentially. The other processes are executed in parallel.
    - FrontISTR: `n_process=8`
- Measurement method
  - Write Input Time(Tw): read from "Time: xx.x" at the bottom of the task panel when "Write input file" is complete
  - Solver time(Ts): read from "xx.x:  [FrontISTR/CalculiX] done without error!" message in FEM Console
  - Total time(Tt): read from "Time: xx.x" at the bottom of the task panel when "Run [FrontISTR/CalculiX]" is complete
  - Loading result time(Tr): Total time - Solve time
  - Max von Mises Stress: read from [FISTR|CCX]_Results



## Results

The performance(Solver time) of CalculiX and FrontISTR for the involute gear model is as follows:
