# Benchmark 04: Spring

![result_mises_small](./result_mises_large.png)

## Settings

- Objective: To compare the performance of CalculiX and FrontISTR on various mesh sizes and matrix solvers
- Model: Spring generated with the part design workbench
  - Analysis type: Static linear
  - Note: This model is elongated and favorable for direct solvers.
- Parameters:
  - Mesh settings: Gmsh, Second order, Second Order Linear=true
    1. Small: Max element size=3.00, 49,713 nodes, 24,813 elements
    2. Middle: Max element size=2.00, 137,283 nodes, 75,058 elements
    3. Large: Max element size=1.30, 402,670 nodes, 242,045 elements
  - Matrix solver settings
    - CalculiX: iterativecholesky(iterative), spooles(direct)
    - FrontISTR: CG w/ AMG preconditioner(iterative), MUMPS(direct)
- Mesurement Environment
  - OS: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19041 N/A Build 19041
  - CPU: Intel Core i7-6700 @3.40GHz 4cores x 1CPU
  - Memory: 16GB
  - FreeCAD 0.19.1 a88db11
  - FrontISTR v5.2 1a5263e1
  - FEM\_FrontISTR 96abb945
  - Paralell settings
    - Calculix: `OMP_NUM_THREADS=4`
      - Note that Iterativecholesky solver runs sequentially. The other processes are executed in parallel.
    - FrontISTR: `n_process=4`
- Measurement method
  - Write Input Time(Tw): read from "Time: xx.x" at the bottom of the task panel when "Write input file" is complete
  - Solver time(Ts): read from "xx.x:  [FrontISTR/CalculiX] done without error!" message in FEM Console
  - Total time(Tt): read from "Time: xx.x" at the bottom of the task panel when "Run [FrontISTR/CalculiX]" is complete
  - Loading result time(Tr): Total time - Solve time
  - Max von Mises Stress: read from [FISTR|CCX]_Results



## Results

The performance(Solver time) of CalculiX and FrontISTR for this model is as follows:
